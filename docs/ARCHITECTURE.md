# Architecture

How the org actually works, layer by layer. If you're an agent reading this:
this describes the system you're part of.

## The five layers

1. **Human (owner).** Sets direction, answers the four gated asks, funds wallets.
   Interface: the `ceo` command and (optionally) cmux floors.
2. **Chat assistant (optional).** Your conversational front door. It reads and
   writes the same org files as everything else — it is *not* the autonomous loop.
3. **Workspace CEO.** The single driver loop (`scripts/workspace-ceo-tick.sh`).
   Coordinates, never codes. Only one instance can run: it claims a lock file
   at startup and a second launch exits immediately.
4. **Project orchestrators.** One per registered project. Run as dispatched
   background jobs (`scripts/project-ceo-agent.sh <id>`); read their handoff, do
   the work, update `STATE.json` + `RECEIPTS.md`, report up to `org/ceo/INBOX.md`.
5. **Workers / subagents.** Per-task LLM invocations a project orchestrator spawns.

## One tick, in detail

`workspace-ceo-tick.sh` loops forever (default every 900 s). Each tick:

1. **Render** the cockpit — org state, provider status, inbox tail — to its pane.
2. **Dispatch** (`omp-supervisor-once.sh`):
   - mark finished jobs by *PID liveness* (not ps-grep);
   - spawn each `queued` job in `org/AGENT_QUEUE.json` as a **detached background
     process** with its own PID file and log under `org/jobs/`;
   - enforce one-job-per-project and a global parallelism cap (default 3);
   - block jobs whose `project_id` isn't registered in `org/OMP_HARNESS.json`
     or whose type isn't in that project's `allowed_job_types`;
   - update cmux status chips (display only — never executes through cmux).
3. **Brain** (`workspace-ceo-agent.sh`) — *only if* watched inputs changed
   (content hash over APPROVALS, INBOX, HUMAN_QUEUE, project STATE files, with
   volatile timestamp fields stripped), or every Nth tick as a heartbeat:
   - processes human approvals (moves them Pending → Processed);
   - decides each project's next step; queues jobs; writes handoffs;
   - escalates *only* the four gated things to `org/HUMAN_QUEUE.md`;
   - writes a receipt to `org/ceo/runs/` — the audit trail.
   A timeout guard kills a hung brain so the loop never freezes.

## Job lifecycle

```
CEO brain ──appends──▶ AGENT_QUEUE.json (status: queued)
tick N+1 dispatcher ──spawns──▶ bash project-ceo-agent.sh <project>   (detached, env: OMP_JOB_*)
                                 │  log: org/jobs/<id>.log   pid: org/jobs/<id>.pid
agent ──writes──▶ project STATE.json + RECEIPTS.md ──appends──▶ org/ceo/INBOX.md
tick N+2 dispatcher ──sees pid dead──▶ status: completed
brain (gate sees INBOX change) ──reads receipt──▶ decides next step
```

Model tiering is automatic: `read-only-worker`/`scout` jobs start on a cheap
fast model (gemini-flash); `implementation-worker`/`project-ceo-run` start on
claude-sonnet. The waterfall handles fallback either way.

## The CLI waterfall (`scripts/lib/ceo-waterfall.sh`)

These are all *command-line tools on PATH*, not bare model names — each wraps
its own vendor's models: `codex` = OpenAI Codex CLI, `claude` = Claude Code,
`gemini` = Google Gemini CLI, `ollama` = local model runtime.

```
codex → claude → gemini → ollama        (workspace CEO skips codex by default
                                         to preserve quota for project work)
```

- Each provider is probed before use; one that errors with a usage/session/rate
  limit is **benched** via a lockout file (`org/ceo/runs/.<provider>-blocked-until`,
  epoch seconds) — 90 min for claude/gemini, 24 h for codex.
- A benched provider is skipped even when explicitly requested — a stale caller
  can never resurrect a rate-limited CLI.
- Expired lockouts self-heal: the probe compares the epoch and unblocks.

## Watchdogs & failure modes

| Failure | Defense |
|---|---|
| duplicate driver loops (quota burn) | lock file claimed atomically at startup; a second copy sees it and exits |
| hung brain | per-run `timeout`, loop continues |
| agent exits 0 having done nothing | post-run content diff → one retry on claude |
| driver dies / forgotten STOP file | status-watch daemon paints a red chip + notification; `ceo` shows ● / ○ |
| owner pauses the org | `touch org/ceo/runs/STOP` (resume: `rm`) — explicit, visible state |
| machine sleeps | ticks simply don't run; loop resumes on wake (use `caffeinate`/a server for 24/7) |

## cmux is display-only

Floors (one cmux workspace per project) show: a live markdown status board, a
log tail of the latest job, status chips, and an *idle interactive* agent REPL
you can talk to directly. **No job ever executes through a cmux pane.** Earlier
versions dispatched work by typing into panes; it was the #1 source of silent
failures. See [LESSONS.md](LESSONS.md).

## Security model

- Keys live outside the repo in `~/.config/omp.env` (chmod 600).
- The four gates are *behavioral*: enforced by every controller prompt, with
  HUMAN_QUEUE as the escalation path — not by an OS sandbox. An agent with
  shell access can read anything your user can. Therefore: dedicated low-value
  wallets only, private repos by default, no real-money keys on the machine.
- Receipts make every decision and action reconstructable after the fact.
